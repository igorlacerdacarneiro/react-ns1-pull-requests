## Take-Home Assignment: Frontend Software Engineering

Dear Candidate Igor Lacerda Carneiro,

Thank you for your interest in the frontend software engineering position at NS1. We appreciate the time you've invested in the application process so far.

As the next step, we would like to invite you to complete a take-home assignment. This assignment is designed to assess your frontend development skills and problem-solving abilities. We estimate that it should take no more than 2 hours to complete.

**Assignment Details:**

You are tasked with recreating a simpler version of the Pull Requests page that displays a list of PRs, for example https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls. The page should fetch a list of PRs using the GitHub API and dynamically render the PRs on the page. Each PR should display its name, price, and an image.

Here are the requirements for the assignment:

- Please use React or similar frameworks.
- Page should display a list of PRs.
- Each PR should contain 3 pieces of information: the name of the PR, the author, and how many comments are on the PR. [[Github API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-pull-requests)]
- Ensure that the web page is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile screens.
- Bonus include some accessibility features.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the package in the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
